# Product Description: Coop Klondike

## Why This Project Exists

Coop Klondike provides a digital implementation of collaborative multiplayer Klondike Solitaire, bringing the classic puzzle experience to modern web platforms with real-time cooperative gameplay. The project serves as both an entertainment application and a demonstration of clean Flutter architecture for real-time multiplayer game development with Firebase integration.

## Problems Solved

- **Social Gaming & Collaboration**: Enables multiple players to work together on solving a single solitaire puzzle in real-time, fostering cooperation and shared problem-solving
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Provides seamless multiplayer interaction with live drag operations and turn-based locking to prevent conflicts
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Offers the familiar solitaire experience on any device with a web browser, with session-based multiplayer rooms accessible via shareable URLs
- **Learning Resource**: Serves as a comprehensive example of Flutter real-time multiplayer game development with Firebase, proper state management, and concurrent operation handling
- **Persistent Gaming**: Enables game sessions that persist across browser sessions and can be resumed by multiple players

## How It Works

### Core Gameplay
- **Standard Klondike Rules**: Implements the traditional 52-card deck solitaire variant with 7 tableau columns, 4 foundation piles, and stock/waste mechanics
- **Collaborative Multiplayer**: Multiple players can join the same game session and work together to solve the puzzle
- **Real-Time Interactions**: All card movements and game state changes are synchronized instantly across all connected players
- **Turn-Based Locking**: Players acquire temporary locks on game actions to prevent conflicts, with automatic 10-second expiration
- **Live Drag Sharing**: Players can see each other's card drag operations in real-time, providing visual feedback of collaborative actions

### Multiplayer Features
- **Session-Based Games**: Games are identified by unique URLs in format `/game/{gameId}` for easy sharing
- **Player Identity**: Each player receives a unique 10-character ID for the session duration
- **Concurrent Actions**: Multiple players can interact simultaneously with automatic conflict resolution
- **Game State Persistence**: Complete game state is stored in Firebase Realtime Database and survives browser refreshes
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Three concurrent Firebase streams handle game state, player locks, and drag positions

### User Experience Flow
1. **Game Creation**: Player navigates to the app and either creates a new game or joins an existing session via URL
2. **Multiplayer Setup**: Game generates a shareable URL that other players can use to join the same session
3. **Collaborative Gameplay**: Players drag cards between tableau columns, foundations, and waste pile with real-time coordination
4. **Action Coordination**: When a player initiates an action, they acquire a temporary lock while other players see the drag operation
5. **Win Condition**: When all cards reach the foundation piles, all players see the victory celebration simultaneously
6. **Session Management**: Games persist in Firebase and can be resumed by any player with the URL

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Multiple players should feel like they're working on the same physical card game
- **Intuitive Coordination**: Lock acquisition and drag sharing should be transparent to users
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: All multiplayer interactions should feel immediate and synchronized
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Players should understand who is performing actions and when conflicts occur
- **Accessible Multiplayer**: Game sessions should be easy to create, share, and join

### Secondary Goals
- **Educational Value**: Codebase serves as a learning resource for Flutter real-time multiplayer game development
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between game logic, Firebase integration, and UI
- **Comprehensive Testing**: High test coverage ensures reliability in complex multiplayer scenarios
- **Robust Concurrency**: Proper handling of race conditions and network issues

### Success Metrics
- **Functional Completeness**: All standard Klondike rules correctly implemented in multiplayer context
- **Smooth Collaboration**: Multiple players can work together without conflicts or synchronization issues
- **Real-Time Performance**: Sub-second latency for all multiplayer interactions
- **Session Reliability**: Game state persists reliably across network disconnections and browser refreshes
- **Code Quality**: Well-tested, documented, and maintainable multiplayer architecture

## Social Features

### Cooperative Gameplay
- **Shared Problem Solving**: Players must coordinate to find the best moves and strategy
- **Visual Communication**: Real-time drag operations serve as non-verbal communication between players
- **Equal Participation**: Any player can make moves, fostering inclusive collaborative gameplay

### Session Management
- **Easy Sharing**: Game URLs can be shared via any communication method
- **Drop-in/Drop-out**: Players can join or leave sessions at any time without disrupting gameplay
- **Persistent Sessions**: Games continue running even when no players are actively connected

### Conflict Resolution
- **Turn-Based Actions**: Lock system ensures only one player can execute moves at a time
- **Automatic Timeout**: Locks expire after 10 seconds to prevent deadlocks
- **Visual Feedback**: All players see when actions are being performed and by whom
