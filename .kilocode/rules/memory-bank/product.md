# Product Description: Coop Klondike

## Why This Project Exists

Coop Klondike provides a digital implementation of the classic Klondike Solitaire card game, bringing the timeless puzzle experience to modern web platforms. The project serves as both an entertainment application and a demonstration of clean Flutter architecture for game development.

## Problems Solved

- **Entertainment & Mental Engagement**: Offers a challenging yet accessible card game that exercises logical thinking, pattern recognition, and strategic planning
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Provides the familiar solitaire experience on any device with a web browser, eliminating the need for platform-specific installations
- **Learning Resource**: Serves as a comprehensive example of Flutter game development with proper state management, testing, and architecture patterns
- **Offline Gaming**: Enables solitaire gameplay without internet connectivity once loaded

## How It Works

### Core Gameplay
- **Standard Klondike Rules**: Implements the traditional 52-card deck solitaire variant with 7 tableau columns, 4 foundation piles, and stock/waste mechanics
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive card movement through mouse/touch drag operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear card states (face-up/down), valid move highlighting, and win condition celebration
- **Game State Management**: Persistent game state with new game functionality and win detection

### User Experience Flow
1. **Game Start**: User launches the web app and sees the initial card layout
2. **Gameplay**: User drags cards between tableau columns, foundations, and waste pile following solitaire rules
3. **Win Condition**: When all cards reach the foundation piles, a victory screen appears
4. **New Game**: User can start a fresh game at any time
