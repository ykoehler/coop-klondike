# Current Context: Coop Klondike

## Current Work Focus

Memory bank documentation update to accurately reflect the multiplayer architecture. Coop Klondike has evolved from a single-player game to a sophisticated real-time multiplayer collaborative solitaire game with Firebase integration for state synchronization and concurrent player coordination.

## Recent Changes

- **Firebase Integration**: Added Firebase Realtime Database for persistent multiplayer game state
- **Multiplayer Architecture**: Implemented real-time collaborative gameplay with URL-based game sessions
- **Concurrency Control**: Added GameLock model with turn-based locking system (10-second expiration)
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Three concurrent Firebase streams (game state, locks, drag positions)
- **Player Identity System**: Unique 10-character player IDs for session-based multiplayer
- **Live Drag Sharing**: DragState model enables real-time drag position synchronization across players
- **Session Management**: URL format `/game/{gameId}` for shareable multiplayer sessions
- **Firebase Service**: New FirebaseService for real-time database operations
- **Lock-Based Actions**: All game actions wrapped in acquire-lock → execute → release-lock pattern
- **Cross-Player UI Updates**: Real-time listeners trigger UI rebuilds across all connected players
- **Game State Persistence**: Complete state stored at Firebase path `/games/{gameId}`
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic lock timeout and visual feedback for concurrent actions

## Next Steps

- Complete memory bank documentation updates to reflect multiplayer architecture
- Address identified synchronization issues in concurrent operations
- Evaluate deployment to Firebase Hosting for production multiplayer sessions
- Consider additional multiplayer features (player indicators, chat, spectator mode)
- Assess testing coverage for multiplayer scenarios and edge cases

## Project Status

- **Codebase**: Complete multiplayer implementation with Firebase integration
- **Features**: All core Klondike rules implemented in real-time collaborative context
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test coverage + E2E testing setup + multiplayer test scenarios needed
- **Architecture**: Clean separation maintained with Firebase service layer for real-time operations
- **Documentation**: Memory bank updates in progress to reflect current multiplayer state
- **Deployment**: Ready for Firebase Hosting deployment with multiplayer session support
