- Created E2E test that validates full game flow including win/stuck detection
- Added test-friendly identifiers (CSS classes and data attributes) to Flutter widgets for reliable Playwright E2E testing

## Next Steps

- Consider deployment preparation
- Evaluate potential feature enhancements (undo functionality, scoring, themes)
- Assess testing coverage completeness
